<!-- 
  Interpolation in unison uppercase built-in Angular pipe
 -->
<!-- 
  Correct usage:
  Based on what I absorbed when we use [] around a property tells Angular
  that you wanted to evaluate its value as an expression.
  - [textContent]="name"
  Angular can translate the interpolation to property too. In this example 
  we told Angular explicitly to evaluate the value as a expression.
  - textContent="{{ name }}"
  Wrong usage:
  Angular no more see the "name" as an expression
  - textContent="name"
 -->
<h2>{{ media.name | uppercase }}</h2>
<!-- 
  Use structural directive to prevent showing this div if watchedOn is empty
  *ngIf is a syntax sugar. In other word it is a short hand of [ngIf]. Instead of
    <ng-template [ngIf]="media.watchedOn"></ng-template>
  Note that <ng-template></ng-template> won't be added to the DOM at any scenario
  *ngIf will do that <ng-template> part for us behind the sense. But in if else 
  we need to use <ng-template> angular element
 -->
<div *ngIf="media.watchedOn">Watched on {{ media.watchedOn }}</div>
<div>{{ media.category }}</div>
<div>{{ media.year }}</div>

    Native DOM events or custom events you have created.
      - Native DOM events in Angular discarded the "on" part as you see here
      - This is #my_convention:
        - Prefix the method name with event name - In this example: Click - and 
          to make it readable I prepend the "on" word too. At last we need a noun
          to state our function name more vividly
