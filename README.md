# Why Angular?

- A standard framework to build dynamic site:
  - Interactivity
  - Data modification
  - Modification
- It is specialized in data binding
- Leverage the client side by using RxJS natively
- Typescript gave it type - Although it is not strongly typed but eventually it is much much better that React/Vue where we have to configure it ourselves
- Component architecture
  - Web component:
    - It is custom tags: `<my-custom-tag></my-custom-tag>`
  - Modularity
  - Reusability
  - IMO each component is a module in fact
- DI
  - Service
    - Separate view from business logics
