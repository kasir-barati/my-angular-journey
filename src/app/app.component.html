    - Property binding syntax to pass data to the child component
    - We call media "binding target" and we call mediaItem "binding source"
    - Angular first starts looking for built-in properties for the tag
      which in this case there is not any built-in property since it is a
      custom element. So at last Angular search for properties annotate with
      @Input.
