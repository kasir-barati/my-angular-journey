  <!-- 
    - Property binding syntax to pass data to the child component
    - We call media "binding target" and we call mediaItem "binding source"
    - Angular first starts looking for built-in properties for the tag
      which in this case there is not any built-in property since it is a
      custom element. So at last Angular search for properties annotate with
      @Input.
    - Here we grab the passed data through the triggered event via the $event variable.
      But we also could do this: (deleteMedia)="onDeleteMedia(media.id)" because we had
      access to it. But I do not suggest it.
      Why? it is simple. It is better to get media through triggered event likewise we
      have do it every day on default events.

    - Note that we have to use micro syntax statement, and just follow this syntax. BTW
      I'd like to see it as a venerable JavaScript for...of

    - Attribute directives: In this example if the condition was truthy the key will be added to
      the auto generated class attribute.

      'medium-series': media.category === 'Series'
    }"
